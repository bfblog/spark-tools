## Regular Expression with named capturing groups

This example uses regular expressions with named capturing groups. Most programming languages support regular expressions and unnamed capturing groups. But in fact, only a few libraries support the named capturing groups. By default, the capturing groups are numbered from 0 ascending. Instead of numbering, named capturing groups assign a name to the group. In this way, names identify a group and the matching content.
As a result, the feature of named capturing groups allows us to split a text into a list of key-value pairs.
